Further Improvements:



Implement real admin authentication with passwords.(no real admin functionality in the existing from).

Add export option (CSV or PDF) for feedback reports.



Notes:



All feedbacks are stored in feedbacks.json.



Sentiment detection uses weighted negative words and per-feedback majority logic.
